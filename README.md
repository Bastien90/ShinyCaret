# ShinyCaret
A shiny app that uses ggplot2 for data analysis and caret for data modeling. One can use the data from the [ISLR package](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) or upload a data set.

The app can be accessed via the following link [Data Analysis and Modeling](https://bastien.shinyapps.io/mlcaret/) or by running the following code in R shiny::runGitHub( "ShinyCaret", "Bastien90"). [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/)  limits the availability of system resources to 1024 mb in the free, hence it is better to run the app locally for larger data sets.
